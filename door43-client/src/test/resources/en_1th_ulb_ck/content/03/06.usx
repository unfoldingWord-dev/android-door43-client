  <verse number="6" style="v" />But Timothy came to us from you and brought us the good news of your faith and love. He told us that you always have good memories of us, and that you long to see us just as we also long to see you.

  <verse number="7" style="v" />Because of this, brothers, we were comforted by you because of your faith, in all our distress and affliction.
