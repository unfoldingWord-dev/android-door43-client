  <verse number="4" style="v" />But you, brothers, are not in darkness so that the day would overtake you like a thief.

  <verse number="5" style="v" />For you are all sons of the light and sons of the day. We are not sons of the night or the darkness.

  <verse number="6" style="v" />So then, let us not sleep as the rest do. Instead, let us keep watch and be sober.

  <verse number="7" style="v" />For those who sleep do so at night, and those who get drunk do so at night.
