  <verse number="3" style="v" />For this is the will of God, your sanctification, that you avoid sexual immorality,

  <verse number="4" style="v" />that each of you know how to possess his own vessel in holiness and honor,

  <verse number="5" style="v" />not in the passion of lust (as the Gentiles who do not know God).

  <verse number="6" style="v" />Let no man transgress and wrong his brother in this matter. For the Lord is an avenger in all these things, just as we forewarned you and testified.
